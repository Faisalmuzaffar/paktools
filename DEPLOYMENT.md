### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] All tools function properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (check Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Error monitoring is working (if implemented)

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor build logs for warnings
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Check Vercel analytics for performance issues
- [ ] Review and merge dependabot PRs
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for failed builds

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze bundle size with `npm run build` and check dist folder
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Optimize images and assets as needed
- [ ] Review and update caching headers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check GitHub Actions logs
2. **Runtime errors**: Check Vercel function logs
3. **Performance issues**: Use Vercel Speed Insights
4. **Dependency conflicts**: Check for version mismatches
